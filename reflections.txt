My thoughts:

What new skills have you learned?

 - I've just refreshed my memory;
What has been easy?
 - Easy parts were: the tree, tags, placing images...;
What has been difficult?

 - Launching Udacity Front End Feedback Extention because it didnt want to test my pages for any reasons;
How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
 - In few words i split the problem from badly defined to well defined analyzing and googling. In other words first of all i try to think how well i understand the problem. In case if my problem well defined i just google. But in case opposite case i met poorly defined issue, i parse the one, take a pensil and draw images and objects such a drawing,graphs what i know about it and what it's arranged of. I disassemble the big issue on lesser part and try solve them separetely. In case of success i assemble it together. So that i did with Feedback Extenstion misfunction.
